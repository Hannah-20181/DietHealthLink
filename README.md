Analysis of the Association Between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and Arthritis

Overviewï¼š
This repository contains the code for analyzing the association between arthritis and the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) using data from the NHANES dataset (2003-2018). The project explores the relationship between DII and the prevalence of arthritis through logistic regression, aiming to determine whether a higher DII score is linked to an increased risk of developing arthritis.

Data
The dataset (merge_data_2) used in this analysis includes variables related to arthritis patients, age, sex, BMI, absence of diabetes, absence of hypertension, and absence of pregnancy from 2003 to 2018. The data were preprocessed to ensure that they were suitable for logistic regression analysis.
